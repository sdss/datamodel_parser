# Datamodel: MaNGA_targets_extNSA_tiled_ancillary



#### General Description

The MaNGA targeting catalog, v1_2_27. This table contains the details of the three
main MaNGA samples, Primary, Primary+, and Secondary, as well as the ancillary targets.
In addition to the targeting information there are details of the tile and IFU allocation
as of 04/27/2018. These tiling and allocation details may change slightly as the survey progresses.
Included are various useful parameters from the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog, v1_0_1,
which was used to select almost all of the targets. A few ancillary targets may have been selected
from elsewhere. Also included are volume weights which can be used to correct the MaNGA sample
selection to a volume limited sample. Targets cover the full SDSS spectroscopic DR7 region although
only approximately 1/3 will be observed in the final survey. See Wake et al. (2017) for further details.
