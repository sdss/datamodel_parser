# Data model: manga-RSS



#### General Description
The MaNGA DRP provides summary row-stacked spectra (RSS; with both logarithmic and linear wavelength solutions) for each galaxy that combine individual fiber spectra of that galaxy across multiple exposures into a single row-stacked format.
The RSS files are a two-dimensional array with horizontal size N_spec and vertical size N = \sum N_fiber(i) where N_fiber(i) is the number of fibers in the IFU targeting this galaxy for the i'th exposure and the sum runs over all exposures.


#### Naming Convention
<code>manga-[plate]-[ifudesign]-[type]RSS.fits.gz</code>, where <code>[plate]</code> is the plate number, <code>[ifudesign]</code> is the design IFU size and number, and <code>[type]</code> is either LOG or LIN indicating whether the file uses a logarithmic or linear based wavelength solution.  The combined <code>[plate]-[ifudesign]</code> is also known as the 'plate-ifu' designation of a given galaxy.


#### Approximate Size
8 MB - 200+ MB (depending on IFU size, wavelength format, and number of exposures)


#### File Type
gzipped multi-extension FITS
