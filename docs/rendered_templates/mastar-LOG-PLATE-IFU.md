# Data Model: mastar



#### General Description
The file includes the final spectra and auxillary information for one or more visits of a MaStar target. It includes three extensions. The first extension gives the stacked spectra, one for each visit combining all exposures during a visit, along with some auxillary information and quality indicator for each stacked spectrum. The second extension gives additional observational information, one entry for each exposure. The third extension contains the spectra from all the exposures during all visits, along with quality indicator for each exposure.


#### Naming Convention
<code>mastar-[type]-[plate]-[ifudesign]\.fits\.gz</code>,  where <code>[plate]</code> is the plate number, <code>[ifudesign]</code> is the design IFU size and number, and <code>[type]</code> is either LOG or LIN indicating whether the file uses a logarithmic or linear based wavelength solution. Only the LOG option is available in DR15.


#### Approximate Size
600 KB - 4 MB (depending the number of visits and the number of exposures)


#### File Type
gzipped multi-extension FITS
