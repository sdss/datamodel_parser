# Data Model: preimage



#### General Description
This files contains multi-wavelength imaging (bands g, r, i, and z)
            for a MaNGA galaxy, as well as the corresponding inverse variance
            and PSF for each band. Their main purpose is to provide broad-band
            aperture photometry at the positions of each MaNGA fibre, which
            are then used to estimate the cumulated SN<sup>2</sup> in the red
            and blue parts of the spectrum. The imaging are normally derived
            from the <a href="http://www.nsatlas.org">NASA-Sloan Atlas</a>. In
            some particular cases where no NSA data is available, the
            preimaging is derived from normal SDSS imaging. To differentiate
            between both sources, refer to the header keyword <code>DSOURCE</code>.
            Flux and inverse variance imaging are 100 by 100 pixels centred on
            the target position. PSF images are 61 by 61 pixels.


#### Naming Convention
<code>preimage-[mangaid]\.fits\.gz</code>, with
            <code>mangaid</code> being the unique identifier for each MaNGA
            target.
