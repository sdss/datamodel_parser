# Datamodel: manga.Pipe3D



#### General Description
<p>For DR15, the version of Pipe3D used was PIPE3D_VER=2.4.3, and this was run on MANGADRP_VER=v2_4_3 reduced data.
The described FITs file consist of a single table including the delivered catalog comprising 94 parameters for 4656 galaxies/cubes (those MaNGA cubes analyzed by Pipe3D with enough quality to derive the main stellar population, emission lines and kinematics properties).
Details of the performed analysis are described in <a ref="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RMxAA..52..171Sttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RMxAA..52..171S">Sanchez et al. (2016b)</a>. The file comprises a single FIT extension in the format of a table, with a single row per galaxy/cube. The galaxy/cube is
easily identified using the <b>manganame</b> (manga-<b>plate</b>-<b>ifudsgn</b>) entries in the table
or the <b>objra</b> and <b>objdec</b> coordinates.</p>
<p>The file is stored in the
<a href="https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr15/manga/spectro/pipe3d/v2_4_3/2.4.3/">https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr15/manga/spectro/pipe3d/v2_4_3/2.4.3/</a></p>
<p>The format is the same as the one adopted for DR14, PIPE3D_VER=2.1.2</p>
